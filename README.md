Decision-Control-Statement

This repository demonstrate information and explanation about Decision Control Statements (i.e. Conditional and Looping starements). 
Decision control statement acts as the backbone of programming, it is necessary to have deep understanding of them. 
This repository contain general description of conditional and looping statements and example on each topic to demostrate the working.

It consist of descriptions along with sample programs based on each topic to get terotical as well as practical understanding. It contains
two folder and one pdf file.
First folder consist of conditional statements i.e(if, if_else, if_elif_else, nested_if_else.). 
Example program is covered on each topic of conditional statement and short description is also present on the respective topics.
Every conditional statement contains five examples each.
Second folder consist of Looping statements i.e(while_loop, for_loop, nested_loop), in additiopn of this it also contains some terminologis 
used with looping statements.
Sample program is available on each topic of Looping statement and the use teminologies(break, pass, continue, break) with respec to looping
is also demonstrated.

Along with the sample program, Hand written note is also availavle for theoretical refernce. 
The note are attempt to explain the concepts in simple and understanable way. 
So to Understand it more accurately, first go through the theory part and then practice the sample codes.
